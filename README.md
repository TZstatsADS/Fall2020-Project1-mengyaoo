### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2020

+ Projec title: Are Americans Who Concerned About Economy Concerned About Covid-19?
+ This project is conducted by Mengyao He

+ Project summary: Americans are worried more worried about economy than Covid-19. Does this means those people are not concerned about the risk of Covid-19? From this analysis, I learned that Americans are very worried about Covid-19 and Economy in the same time.
